# Block Isometric PEPS

Compute excited states of locally interacting Hamiltonians (e.g. 2D Transverse Ising Model) with isometric tensor networks.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies. 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Run Unit Tests
To verify that everything is working correctly, run:

```bash
python unit_tests.py
```

### Compute Eigenpairs of the 2D Transverse Field Ising Hamiltonian
Run the following script:

```bash
python ising_model_2D.py
```
